# ConcileTime 

This code sample project accompanies the Naïve Sherpa Blog Post Series.  See the bottom of this README for links to the associated blog posts.

## Description

This repository contains a complete project that is intended to accompany a series with the theme [Naïve Sherpa](https://blogs.sap.com/2019/07/22/00-naive-sherpa-meet-the-naive-sherpa/).  The goal of the repository owner is to synchronize  a tag of the repo that is coordinated with the publishing of a corresponding blog posting.  It provides a fully functional multitenant application based on the Cloud Application Programming(CAP) development model illustrating integration techniques.  As this project grows the owner/author invites other who may wish to contribute to the development efforts.

## Requirements

 - A productive [Cloud Foundry account provided by SAP Cloud Platorm](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/CP/).  While some aspects may be possible to demonstrate with a trial account, the scope and duration of this project lends it to the features of a full productive account.

 - A grasp of [micro-services architecture](https://12factor.net/) and a sense of [SAP's Cloud Application Programming model](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/).

## Download and Installation

 - Clone this repo [https://github.tools.sap/partnereng/partner-eng-conciletime](https://github.tools.sap/partnereng/partner-eng-conciletime) into your local system or IDE of choice.
 
## Limitations

 - Not all features and techniques will be demonstorable with Cloud Foundry trial accounts.

## To-Do (upcoming changes)

Tools used throughout the development of this project are evolving and my change over time.  This may result in discrepencies in the exact procedures or screen-clips in the accompanying blog posts.  All efforts will be made to update the content in order to keep pace with the toolsing, but cannot be guarenteed.
